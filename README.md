In this project I analylized pizza sales based on Pizza category, monthly orders , total revenue, total order.
Used SQL server Management studio for Sql queries to calculate KPI.
Used PowerBi to create sales dashboard.

Initial step was 1) data cleaning  which includes operations like checking data types, renaming columns, remove duplicates etc,
2) Creating different measures using DAX queries.

Further perform visualization using various charts. 
Created KPI : Total revenue, Total order, average order value, Total pizza sold, Average pizza per order 
to monitor and evaluate the performance of critical metrics and objectives in real-time
Implemented filters or slicers on the dashboard to allow users to interactively explore the data.
